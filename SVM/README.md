### Objective: Classify Types of Breast Cancer as Benign or Malignant
This project utilises well known libraries available in the Python language for data manipulation, and data science. 
In this project, I explore using these tools and explore machine learning in Python. 


### The Data: Supplied Dataset from sklearn
(Breast Cancer Data)
