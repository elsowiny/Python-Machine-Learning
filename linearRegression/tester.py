"""
In this project, we will be exploring linear regression, which is essentially a best fit line that is dependent on our input.
We will be using linear regression on our data set to predict the student's final grades.
Linear regression is best used when the data is correlated. 
In our case we will be observing data from the student's past grades, their studytime, their failures, and their absences.
