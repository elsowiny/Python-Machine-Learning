###Objective: To predict student's final grades based on a student performance dataset
This project utilises well known libraries available in the Python language for data manipulation, and data science. In this project, I explore using these tools and explore machine learning in Python. The project consists of downloading a large data set of student performance. Using Python, and specific libraries such as pandas and numpy, we are able to perform linear regression on our data in order to predict students final grades based on a series of attributes.

###The Data: UCI Machine Learning Repository
(Student data that will be used to predict grades, included as a csv file)

##Linear Regression
Our first approach at predicting student's final grades will consist of our program implementing the linear regression algorithim to which it will generate a best fit line through the data points. The line is defined as y = mx + b (a familiar equation)
Once the program finds this best fit line, we will use it to predict certain values, in this case final grades.
