# K-Nearest Neighbors
#### [Python Machine Learning Repo](https://github.com/elsowiny/Python-Machine-Learning)

### Objective: Classify cars based on attributes
This project utilises well known libraries available in the Python language for data manipulation, and data science.
In this project, I explore using these tools and explore machine learning in Python. 
The project consists of downloading a large data set of car attributes. 
Using Python, and specific libraries such as sklearn, we are able to perform the k-nearest neighbors algorithm on our data
in order to predict a cars class based on our car evaluation dataset.

### The Data: UCI Machine Learning Repository
(Car Evaluation Dataset)

The algorithm essentially looks at the K nearest neighbors of the datapoint we are looking to predict,
and sees what class the neighbors belong to the most and classifies it accordingly
